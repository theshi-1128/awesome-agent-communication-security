<h2>📝 Abstract</h2>

<p align="justify">
Copyright protection for large language models is of critical importance, given their substantial development costs, proprietary value, and potential for misuse. Existing surveys have predominantly focused on techniques for tracing LLM-generated content—namely, text watermarking—while a systematic exploration of methods for protecting the models themselves (i.e., model watermarking and model fingerprinting) remains absent. Moreover, the relationships and distinctions among text watermarking, model watermarking, and model fingerprinting have not been comprehensively clarified.
</p>

<p align="justify">
This work presents a comprehensive survey of the current state of LLM copyright protection technologies, with a focus on model fingerprinting, covering the following aspects:
</p>

<div align="justify">
  <ol>
    <li>
      Clarifies the conceptual connection from text watermarking to model watermarking and fingerprinting, and adopts a unified terminology that incorporates model watermarking into the broader fingerprinting framework.
    </li>
    <li>
      Provides an overview and comparison of diverse text watermarking techniques, highlighting cases where such methods can function as model fingerprinting.
    </li>
    <li>
      Systematically categorizes and compares existing model fingerprinting approaches for LLM copyright protection.
    </li>
    <li>
      Presents, for the first time, techniques for fingerprint transfer and fingerprint removal.
    </li>
    <li>
      Summarizes evaluation metrics for model fingerprints, including effectiveness, harmlessness, robustness, stealthiness, and reliability.
    </li>
    <li>
      Discusses open challenges and future research directions.
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

<p align="justify">
This survey aims to offer researchers a thorough understanding of both text watermarking and model fingerprinting technologies in the era of LLMs, thereby fostering further advances in protecting their intellectual property. We will continue to maintain and update this curated list of related papers and resources in this repository.

This project is a website version of our arXiv paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11548" target="_blank">"Copyright Protection for Large Language Models: A Survey of Methods, Challenges, and Trends"</a>, aiming to provide a more interactive and accessible platform for researchers and practitioners in the field of LLM copyright protection. We begin with a comprehensive preliminary section that introduces essential background knowledge for understanding various LLM IP protection methods. We provide updated definitions of key concepts such as model watermarking and model fingerprinting in the context of 2025, enabling newcomers to clearly distinguish between these often-confused concepts.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Our ultimate goal is to present a comprehensive pipeline of copyright protection methods for large language models. From contemporary model fingerprint definitions to fingerprint embedding (and extraction) techniques, and from fingerprint transfer to removal strategies, we provide an end-to-end overview of the entire process.
</p>

<p align="justify">
🌟 This website serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners, providing quick access to paper references, code links, and future resources for paper interpretation and analysis.
